# Hi, I´m Alex! 

## I just left the starting point to build up some skills as a Web Developer to widen my professional setup.

### I am based in Munich where I started my academic career with a B.A. in Political Science with Law as a minor at LMU Munich and worked on projects for a small consulting company/think tank in the Politics sector. Beside that I am a freelance translator and enjoy the huge variety of topics that come across me in the following fields:

##### - travel :world_map:
##### - culinary :wine_glass:
##### - films & media :red_envelope:
##### - sports :tennis:

#### It´s probably no coincidence that these topics match my private interests pretty well. What I am still waiting for is a project about football - so please feel free...  :soccer: :wink:
