# Hi, IÂ´m Alex!

## I just left the starting point to build up some skills as a Web Developer to widen my professional setup.

### I am based in Munich, Germany, where I started my academic career with a B.A. in Political Science with Law as a minor and worked for a small consulting company/think tank in the Politics sector. Beside that I am a freelance translator and enjoy the huge variety of topics that come across me this way from travelling to the production of Gin.
