# Hi, IÂ´m Alex!

## I just left the starting point to build up some skills as a Web Developer to widen my professional setup.

I am based in Munich, Germany, where I started my academic career with a B.A. in Political Science with Law as a minor and worked for a small consulting company/think in the Politics sector.
